Displays for incoming and outgoing vehicles, to be found in the assets menu.
Turn the updates on or off with the bottom bar. When turned on, they update every 5 seconds.
If you add a pair of brackets to your line names, the displays will show the stuff between the brackets, same as https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2528202101. The only difference is: if you add no brackets, the whole line name will be displayed. You can play with this, here some examples: "(IC 335) London - Rosenheim" will show as "IC 335". "Schnellzug (Flieg)ende( Kartof)fel" will show as "Flieg Kartof". Anything plus () will show no name at all.

I have been thinking long and hard whether to publish this mod or not, since I copied the idea from badgerrhax. However, this is my own code and my own models, so I do. If you don't like it, don't use it.

NOTES:
1) These things can be performance-intensive, so you can switch them on and off from the bottom bar (toggle the orange icon). Some other mods, such as advanced statistics, priority signals or shunting, hog game_script.update(). The game can only take so much, so you might need to choose.
2) If you think they are not working, check your bottom bar (toggle the orange icon), unpause the game and wait a little.
3) Once you attached a display to a station, it will be tied to it forever. If you bulldoze the station, its displays will disappear automatically, as soon as you unpause the game.
4) Accuracy improves over time.
5) Accuracy goes down when you add or remove vehicles, it picks up again after a bit.
6) Rearrange these at any time with https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2748222965.

A big thank you goes out to Mr F from UG, this mod would have never worked without his help.
Another big thank you goes out to badgerrhax for the idea.
